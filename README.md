I'm teaching myself Rust! There are many many reasons for this, which I will
write down if (1) I find the time (2) someone actually wants to know.

Resources (so far):

- [*Ray Tracing in One
  Weekend*](https://www.amazon.com/Ray-Tracing-Weekend-Minibooks-Book-ebook/dp/B01B5AODD8) by Peter Shirley
- [*The Rust Programming Language* (second
  edition)](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/)
- [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/)
- [Going down the rabbit hole with Rust
  traits](http://www.jonathanturner.org/2016/02/down-the-rabbit-hole-with-traits.html)
by Jonathan Turner
- [Abstraction without overhead: traits in
  Rust](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2015/05/11/traits.html) (on the rust-lang
blog)

Chapters:

1. Hello, World! (`hello_world.rs`)
2. Slightly improved hello world (`hello_world_better.rs`)
3. Rays, a simple camera, and background (`simple_camera.rs`)
4. Spheres! (`simple_sphere.rs`)
5. Surface normals (shading spheres) (`single_shaded_spheres.rs`)
6. Multiple hitable surfaces (`multiple_spheres.rs`)
