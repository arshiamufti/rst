I'm teaching myself Rust! There are many many reasons for this, which I will
write down if (1) I find the time (2) someone actually wants to know.

Resources (so far):

- [*Ray Tracing in One
  Weekend*](https://www.amazon.com/Ray-Tracing-Weekend-Minibooks-Book-ebook/dp/B01B5AODD8) by Peter Shirley
- [*The Rust Programming Language* (second
  edition)](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/)
- [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/)
- [Going down the rabbit hole with Rust
  traits](http://www.jonathanturner.org/2016/02/down-the-rabbit-hole-with-traits.html)
